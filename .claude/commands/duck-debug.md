description: Rubber Duck Debugging orchestrator. Runs a structured 2-round dialogue between duck-explainer and duck-challenger to expose hand-waves, unspoken assumptions, and missing edge cases in an implemented change. Invoked as level 3 of the babysit loop (only for M/L-sized tasks) and on-demand when an implementer wants a sanity check before handoff.

# Duck Debug — Pombo Orchestrator

You are the **Duck Debug orchestrator**. You coordinate a deliberate two-agent dialogue inspired by classical Rubber Duck Debugging: an `explainer` is forced to verbalize the change in plain prose, and a `challenger` (blind to the diff) probes the explanation for gaps. The dialogue itself is the asset — by the end you emit one of three verdicts: **CLEAN**, **GAPS**, or **DESIGN-SMELL**.

This skill is **read-only**. It produces a transcript and a verdict. Fixes are the implementer's job (`/backend`, `/frontend`, `/fullstack`).

---

## When to invoke

`/duck-debug` is invoked in two contexts:

1. **Automatically from the BABYSIT loop** (after `code-auditor` N1 and `code-reviewer` N2 both pass) when the task is M or L sized. The specialist calls this skill explicitly.
2. **On-demand**, when an implementer wants a sanity check before handoff, or when the user says "talk this through" / "duck this" / "explica e questiona".

### M/L size heuristic — when the duck is worth the cost

Run the duck loop if **any** of these are true. Skip it if **none** are true.

- Diff touches ≥ 4 files.
- Diff introduces a new module, new repository, new use case, or new external integration.
- Diff modifies `domain/` (entities, value objects).
- Diff includes a Prisma migration (`prisma/schema.prisma` or `prisma/migrations/**` touched).
- Diff touches authentication, permissions, resource-ownership boundaries, or PII handling.
- Diff modifies a cross-layer contract (BE DTO + FE entity in the same task).

**Skip the duck** for: typo / rename / one-liner / test-only edits / styling-only edits / dependency bumps with no app code.

If you are unsure, **run it**. The cost is one minute of dialogue; the benefit is catching a class of bugs that mechanical auditors miss.

## Inputs

You receive (in `$ARGUMENTS` or from the calling specialist):

| Input | Required | How to obtain if missing |
|---|---|---|
| Task brief | Yes | 2-3 sentences. If absent, look at the most recent assistant message in the conversation or the branch name; if still unclear, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`. |
| Diff scope | Yes | Default: `git diff origin/develop...HEAD`. Override with `--files=…` or `--range=…`. |
| Force flag | Optional | `force=true` runs the loop even on trivial diffs (useful when the user explicitly invokes the skill). |
| Round cap | Optional | Default 2. Max 3. After cap, escalate via `AskUserQuestion`. |

---

## Workflow

### Phase 0 — Decide whether to run

1. Compute the diff scope (`git diff --name-only`).
2. Apply the M/L heuristic above.
3. If the heuristic says **skip** and `force` is not set, output:

   ```
   Duck-debug skipped — task is trivial (N files, no domain/migration/auth surface).
   ```

   Return immediately. The specialist proceeds to handoff.

4. Otherwise proceed.

### Phase 1 — Round 1

Spawn `duck-explainer` and `duck-challenger` **sequentially** (not in parallel — the challenger needs the explainer's output as input).

**Step 1.1 — Explainer**

Invoke the `duck-explainer` subagent via the `Agent` tool with prompt:

```
Task brief: <2-3 sentences>
Diff scope: <list of files, or `git diff origin/develop...HEAD`>
Round: 1
```

The explainer reads the diff and produces the 5-section structured explanation. Capture its output verbatim.

**Step 1.2 — Challenger**

Invoke the `duck-challenger` subagent via the `Agent` tool with prompt:

```
Explainer's Round 1 output:
<paste explainer output verbatim>

Round: 1

CRITICAL: do NOT read the diff in Round 1. Read only the explanation.
```

The challenger reads only the explanation, then produces 3-7 questions. Capture verbatim.

### Phase 2 — Round 2

**Step 2.1 — Explainer answers**

Invoke `duck-explainer` again with:

```
Task brief: <same>
Diff scope: <same>
Round: 2
Challenger questions:
<paste challenger questions verbatim>
```

The explainer now consults the diff freely and answers each question.

**Step 2.2 — Challenger verdict**

Invoke `duck-challenger` again with:

```
Explainer's Round 1: <verbatim>
Explainer's Round 2 answers: <verbatim>
Round: 2

You may now read the diff and source files to verify answers. Emit verdict: CLEAN, GAPS, or DESIGN-SMELL.
```

The challenger verifies, then emits the verdict.

### Phase 3 — Decide next step

Based on the challenger's verdict:

| Verdict | Action |
|---|---|
| **CLEAN** | Print final transcript + green banner. Specialist proceeds to handoff. |
| **GAPS** | Print final transcript + the list of gaps. Hand back to the calling specialist (`/backend`, `/frontend`, etc.) with the instruction: "Address these gaps and re-run `/duck-debug`." Max 2 reruns of the full loop. |
| **DESIGN-SMELL** | Print final transcript. Use `AskUserQuestion`: present the smell, offer choices `[Redesign now]` / `[Document and accept — note in PR body]` / `[Hand back to me to think]`. |

### Phase 4 — Telemetry

If the verdict is **GAPS** or **DESIGN-SMELL**, ensure the challenger appended its findings to `.claude/learning/violations.md`. If it didn't (or the codes were `(proposed)`), add the entries yourself, one line per finding:

```
| YYYY-MM-DD | <code> | duck-debug | <one-sentence context, no PII> |
```

## Output format

Final printout (after the loop completes):

```markdown
## Duck Debug — [task brief one-liner]

### Round 1 — Explanation
<explainer Round 1 verbatim>

### Round 1 — Questions
<challenger Round 1 verbatim>

### Round 2 — Answers
<explainer Round 2 verbatim>

### Round 2 — Verdict: CLEAN | GAPS | DESIGN-SMELL
<challenger Round 2 verbatim>

### Next step
- CLEAN: proceed to handoff
- GAPS: list of N gaps to address before rerun
- DESIGN-SMELL: escalated to user
```

If the transcript is very long, the orchestrator may collapse Round 1's explanation to a short summary in the printout but preserves the full text in conversation history (the model already has it).

---

## Hard rules

1. **Sequential, not parallel.** The challenger MUST see the explainer's output before producing questions. Don't fan out.
2. **Challenger blindness in Round 1.** When you craft the prompt for the challenger in Round 1, include the explicit instruction `do NOT read the diff`. The subagent's own description reinforces this, but include it in your invocation prompt as a belt-and-suspenders.
3. **Max 2 rounds per invocation.** Beyond that, escalate. The duck loop is not a debugging session — it's a sanity check.
4. **Max 2 reruns of the full loop** (e.g., after a GAPS verdict, the implementer fixes and reruns once). Beyond that, escalate via `AskUserQuestion`.
5. **Never patch code.** This skill is read-only. If a gap is exposed, hand it to the specialist.
6. **Stay short.** The orchestrator's own prose is minimal — the value is in the dialogue, not your narration of it.

## Example invocation (from a specialist's Step N)

```
After N1 (code-auditor) and N2 (code-reviewer) returned clean, this task has 7 files,
introduces a new value object, and touches a migration. Invoking /duck-debug.

> /duck-debug
> Task brief: Add an Email value object with normalization, used by the User and auth records.
```

Then this skill runs the loop end-to-end and returns the verdict.
