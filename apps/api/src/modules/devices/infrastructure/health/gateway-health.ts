 * devices are currently CONNECTED, but a disconnected device does NOT make the
 * process unhealthy. Individual sessions drop and reconnect all the time; the
 * process is fine as long as it's running (and it exits on advisory-lock loss).
 * Container liveness is `/healthz` (always 200), so a transiently-disconnected
 * device can never trip a restart and cause a mass drop.
