# DevOps / Infra — Accumulated Knowledge (single source)

> Living notes for the `/devops` skill: the real deploy topology, runbook, and backlog **as you build it**.
> The boilerplate ships a representative `infra/` skeleton; replace the specifics below with your actual
> provider, hosts, and domains as production takes shape. Command cheat-sheet: `DEPLOY.md`. Ops: `Makefile`.

## Architecture (reference — adapt to your provider)
- Static frontends behind a CDN + an API and its data stores on isolated hosts joined by a private network / tunnel.
- A proxy/CDN at the edge hides the origin IP (origin cert) and terminates TLS.
- The database host never exposes `5432`/`6379` to the internet — app↔DB only over the private network.
- Backup is 3-2-1: encrypted daily dump, offsite, with a dead-man switch — and only "real" after a tested restore drill.

## Golden rules
1. Database first when provisioning (with backup on day one), then app host, then frontends, then validation.
2. Secrets live in `.env` (`chmod 600`) / Docker secrets on the server — never in the image (except the stamped `APP_VERSION`), never in logs/commits/front.
3. Health: `/healthz` (text `ok`) + `/api/health` (JSON with `version`).

## CI/CD (reference)
- `yarn make-tag` builds + stamps a versioned image and creates the git tag.
- `yarn deploy` / `yarn rollback` pull a tag on the host and verify the version via `/api/health`.
- `yarn monitor-status` shows service health.

## Runbook — when to run what
- (fill in as your deploy matures)

## Gaps / backlog
- (none yet)
