/**
 * The current pairing QR for a device, for the connect modal's poll. The `qr`
 * is only present while the device is `QR_PENDING` (a QR is live and waiting to
 * be scanned); in every other status it is `null` — that is NOT an error, the
 * frontend uses `status` to decide what to render. Scoped by account (R1).
 *
 * The `status` (DB) and `qr` (in-process gateway cache) are two independent
 * reads, so a transient `{ status: "QR_PENDING", qr: null }` can occur: the QR
 * rotates ~every 30s, and right at a handshake/rotation boundary (or after a
 * process restart that lost the cache) the status may say QR_PENDING while the
 * cache is momentarily empty. This is self-healing — the frontend renders a
 * skeleton for that poll and the next 3s poll carries the fresh QR.
